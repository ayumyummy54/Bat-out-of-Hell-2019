<p>Although Jim began in theatre he is best known as a songwriter/producer whose records have sold more than 200,000,000 million copies&nbsp;worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;The L.A. Times described him as \"the Richard Wagner of rock.\" At Amherst College he wrote and starred in an epic musical&nbsp;called The Dream Engine.&nbsp;It caused a sensation and N.Y. Shakespeare Festival's Joe Papp bought the rights at intermission. &nbsp;His first professional musical was&nbsp;More Than You Deserve&nbsp;at Papp&rsquo;s Public Theatre, where he worked for five years.&nbsp; When a singer named Meat Loaf auditioned for him,&nbsp;Spin&nbsp;Magazine called the meeting \"one of the top ten most important moments in the history of rock and roll.\"</p>
<p>Then came his first record, the legendary&nbsp;Bat Out Of Hell,&nbsp;with Meat Loaf in 1977.&nbsp; It remains the biggest debut album ever and the second best selling disc of all time.&nbsp; Jim is the only person in the Top 20 Albums of All Time to have written all songs alone, both&nbsp;music and lyrics. The sequel, 1993's Bat Out Of Hell II: Back Into Hell, topped the charts in 38 countries. &nbsp;He wrote all of the songs on 2016's chart topping, Braver Than We Are, again by Meat Loaf.</p>
<p>Number 1 songs include: Total Eclipse Of The Heart (four times, 1983, 1995, 2003 and 2017); Paradise By The Dashboard Light; Dead Ringer For Love; Making Love Out Of Nothing At All; Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad; Holding Out For A Hero; I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That) &ndash; biggest rock single sales ever; It's All Coming Back To Me Now, which was named the 1997 Song Of The Year by BMI, for having had the most broadcasts worldwide - 1.6 million; and No Matter What, by Boyzone (record of the year in England for 1998 and #1 in 18 countries - the most successful single ever released from a musical in history). He won a Grammy award as producer for Best Album of the Year, Celine Dion's&nbsp;Falling Into You. He made one platinum album as a singer,&nbsp;Bad For Good.</p>
<p>Film music includes:&nbsp;Footloose;&nbsp;Streets Of Fire;&nbsp;The Shadow; and Mask Of Zorro.&nbsp; Musicals include Whistle Down The Wind, with score by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Jim Steinman.&nbsp; He also wrote the score for&nbsp;Tanz der Vampire, a musical staged by Roman Polanski, which opened in Vienna, October of 1997 to rave reviews, record box office&nbsp;and is currently still selling out theatres as it&nbsp;launches it's 20th Anniversary production.&nbsp; Tanz der Vampire is running throughout Europe (this year in St. Gallen, Switzerland plus&nbsp;Stuttgart, Hamburg and&nbsp;Cologne, Germany, Vienna, Austria&nbsp;and in Prague, Czech Republic). It has also played&nbsp;in other major world cities&nbsp;including&nbsp;Berlin,&nbsp;St. Petersburg, Moscow,&nbsp;Budapest, Warsaw, Helsinki, New York, Paris, Antwerp, Helsinki, Budapest&nbsp;and Tokyo.&nbsp; Jim&nbsp;has also conceived and executive produced the film, and wrote songs/score for Wuthering Heights, 2003, for MTV.</p>
<p>Jim Steinman was inducted in to the Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 2012, received an honorary doctorate degree from his alma mater, Amherst College, in 2013 and entered the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in November, 2016.</p>
<p>In 2017, three special limited-run productions of Bat Out Of Hell The Musical&nbsp;played&nbsp;to nearly half a million people in Manchester and&nbsp;London, England as well as Toronto, Canada.&nbsp; Playing to sold-out houses the show immediately gathered a devoted following among audiences and all three engagements required extensions to meet ticket demand.&nbsp; Critics also embraced the show with book, music and lyrics all written by Jim Steinman,&nbsp;directed by Jay&nbsp;Scheib.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2 cd cast album, which Jim produced and includes two new songs written specifically for the show,&nbsp;is currently on sale.&nbsp; Additional productions are planned 2018.</p>
<p>Jim Steinman's distinctive, over-the-top style has influenced a genre of music and such songs are often referred to as \"Steinmanesque.\" &nbsp;He is known as the \"Father of the Power Ballad\" and is&nbsp;one of the founders of epic rock.&nbsp; He also played a vital role in the birth of music videos as we know them.&nbsp; Jim Steinman's music has permeated popular culture the world over in a way that is unequalled by any composer or songwriter that has ever lived.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jimsteinman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.jimsteinman.com</a></p>
